 * Basic GA code should be cleaned up: in principle, only a function
   is needed which creates a new population from an existing one. The
   rest can be moved to a base class of a genetic algorithm factory.
 * Use a more general kind of ID for the genomes, to help track the
   evolution. In a multi-objective GA, the non-dominated set is not
   entirely present in each population, so the index in the population
   array cannot be used for this.
